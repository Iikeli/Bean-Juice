A simple app for coffee brewing recipes

![screenshot](bean-juice-ss.jpg "Screeshot")
  
Bean Juice is a simple coffee recipe app for iOS.
Bean Juice is completely written in SwiftUI. It leverages CloudKit and is in the middle of a refactor to more modular architecture using SPM and removing CocoaPods.

I am also in the process of adding more community guidelines and resources for people interesting in contributing to the project.
